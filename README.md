Secure Chat Application


🔐 # Cipher Connect

The Secure Chat Platform is a secure, real-time, multi-user communication system that employs end-to-end encryption to protect messages. Using a dynamic combination of RSA and SDES algorithms, it ensures both robust security and high performance. Designed for modern cybersecurity needs, this platform is user-friendly and tailored for secure communications within organizations.

#✨ Key Features
🔒 End-to-End Encryption: Only intended recipients can decrypt and read messages.
⚙️ Dynamic Encryption Switching: Automatically toggles between RSA and SDES based on server load and conditions.
💬 Real-Time Messaging: Smooth communication for multiple users simultaneously.
✅ User Authentication: Ensures that only authorized users can access the platform.
🔑 Secure Key Exchange: Protects encryption keys during transmission.
